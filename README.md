# Modelling foreign tourists in Switzerland: Main mode choice model
This code estimates a discrete choice model for the choice of main transport mode used by foreign tourists in Switzerland. This logit model is estimated using the data of the <a href="https://www.stnet.ch/de/marktforschung/tourismus-monitor-schweiz/">Tourism Monitor Switzerland (TMS)</a> from <a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/">Switzerland Tourism</a>. Estimation results will be presented at the <a href="https://strc.ch/">23rd Swiss Transport Research Conference (STRC 2023)</a>, taking place in May  on the <a href="https://www.monteverita.org/">Monte Verit√†</a>, Ascona (Ticino) at the <a href="https://csf.ethz.ch/">Centro Stefano Franscini</a> of <a href="https://ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich</a>.
